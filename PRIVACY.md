# Privacy Policy for Gemini Chat Exporter

**Last Updated:** February 5, 2026

## Overview

Gemini Chat Exporter is a browser extension that allows you to export your Google Gemini conversations to Markdown files. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

This extension:
- ❌ Does NOT collect your conversations
- ❌ Does NOT send data to external servers
- ❌ Does NOT track your usage
- ❌ Does NOT use analytics services
- ❌ Does NOT store cookies or identifiers

## How It Works

All processing happens **locally in your browser**:

1. When you click "Download Chat", the extension reads the currently open Gemini conversation from your browser
2. The conversation is processed and converted to Markdown format **entirely on your device**
3. The resulting file is saved directly to your computer
4. **Nothing is sent over the internet**

## Permissions Explained

The extension requests the following Chrome permissions:

- **`activeTab`**: To read the current Gemini conversation page
- **`scripting`**: To inject code that extracts chat content
- **`tabs`**: To detect when you're on a Gemini page (for icon state)

These permissions are used **only** for the core functionality of exporting conversations. No data is collected or transmitted.

## Data Storage

The extension does not store any data. The only file created is the Markdown export file that you explicitly download.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does **NOT** use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.
